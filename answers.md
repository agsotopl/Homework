# Define 3 questions for your evaluation and explain why you selected these questions

1. Which model gives a more detailed response to a prompt?
2. Which model uses simpler language that a 10-year-old would understand better?
3. Does the chatbot remember information from earlier in the conversation?

# Answer your 3 questions using the following 4 scenarios:
## One URL for each of the two models

1. Which model gives a more detailed response to a prompt?

Although ChatGPT gives more in its responses, Claude's llm gives a far more structured and readable response. Calude's responses are broken into more sections, which are also more consise and digestable.

2. Which model uses simpler language that a 10-year-old would understand better?

Because Claude's response was more digestable than ChatGPT's, it is far more understandable to people with a lower ability to ingest prolonged explanations. Each section of a Claude response usually had about four bullet points which were no longer than 7 words long. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's response usually had less sections, with each one have around 10 bullet points, many of which were longer, and had no connection to the previous bullet point.

3. Does the chatbot remember information from earlier in the conversation?

The chatbot, although designed to have 6 message system memory, was able to recall the prompts that were input into it. Claude did preform better in this regard, however, as it could recall exact questions, as where ChatGPT simply summarized the general focus of previously submitted prompts.

## Both URLs for each of the two models

1. Which model gives a more detailed response to a prompt?

In this instance, with further context, ChatGPT performed a little better when it came to the details of the sport of baseball. 

2. Which model uses simpler language that a 10-year-old would understand better?

Claude reamains the more digestable and easy to understand model. Although ChatGPT was more detailed, it still has the same issues as it did when there was only one URL, with the responses being far too long and drawn out for children to ingest.

3. Does the chatbot remember information from earlier in the conversation?

The memory seemed unaffected with the addition of a second URL. 

# Compare the output generated for these 4 scenarios
1. Did having both documents improve the answers? Explain why.

The answers were more detailed with the addition of a second document. However, this listened the quality of ChatGPT's responses, as they lacked the conciseness necessary for easy digestability.

2. Which model was best? Explain why.

I believe Claude performed better overall, as explaining the game of baseball can be tedious, especially when the LLM response is too detailed or not concise enough. It kind've felt like ChatGPT added details that weren't necessary, as where Claude only kept necesary details, while also providing responses with better structure and logical hierarchy.
